    <p><strong>The history of English food  in antiquity with various ancient cultures </strong></p>

    <p>Great Britain – three very different countries, England, Scotland and Wales, each with a rich and varied history and culture. Perhaps this explains the diversity of its culinary traditions.</p>

      <p>The history of Britain has played a large part in its traditions, its culture – and its food. The Romans for instance brought us cherries, stinging nettles ( to be used as a salad vegetable), cabbages and peas, as well as improving the cultivation of crops such as corn.
         And they brought us wine! The Romans were prolific road builders, these roads allowing for the first time the easy transportation of produce throughout the country.</p>

    <h3>Fish & Chips</h3>

    <p>For any international visitor, fish & chips is a must-try. It has been a British favourite for well over 150 years.</P>

    <h3>Pies</h3>

    <p>Despite not originating in Britain, there’s absolutely no doubt that the meat pie has come to be heavily associated
       with the British Isles. The proliferation of pies was actually born out of a problem – storage issues. 
       With boat crews needing to be sustained during trips, but not being able to accommodate livestock, 
       pies were created as an economical (and delicious) way to store and preserve meat.
        While we can find pies in many guises across the world,
         the Great British meat pie (typically beef) remains a favourite across the country.
        <br><span style="color:black;font-weight:bold">'Where to try:'</span>When it comes to pies in London, The Windmill (6-8 Mill St) in Mayfair has won awards for its delicious steak & mushroom pies – as well as its chicken, bacon & leek pies.

    <h3>'Sunday Roast'</h3>

    <p>Another tradition of the British Isles, the Sunday roast is an incredibly filling dish that – as the name suggests – is almost always consumed on Sundays. While many variations exist, the standard components include roast meat, stuffing, roast potatoes, Yorkshire puddings (a savoury, batter-based pastry), roast vegetables and gravy. So precious is this dish to the UK public that it was voted second in a poll of what they most love about Britain.<br>
                    <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold">'Where to try:'</span> Check out the Pig & Butcher (80 Liverpool Rd) in Islington – your eyes and your stomach won’t be let down by their Sunday roast.

    <h3>Chicken Tikka Masala</h3>
    <p>Considered a national dish, this gloriously delicious Indian curry is wildly popular across the entire UK. While many stories surround its origin – it’s thought to have been invented somewhere in Britain (possibly Glasgow in Scotland), or in Punjab (Northern India and Eastern Pakistan) – Britain has a long relationship with the Punjab area and the dish can be celebrated as a creation that likely came into fruition because of that relationship.
                 <br>
                    <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold">'Where to try:'</span> In London, you can’t go wrong with sampling chicken tikka masala at Punjab (80 Neal St) – the UK’s oldest North Indian restaurant.

    <h3>Roast Duck</h3>
    <p>
        .While roast duck might typically be associated with Chinese cuisine, it is enjoyed around the world every day with Britons enjoying their roast duck just as much as the next country. Done in a number of different ways, Brits consider roast duck a treat for special occasions, and if you’re visiting London, that more than meets the criteria for a special occasion!

    <h3>Afternoon Tea</h3>
    <p>
        If you’re coming to Britain for the first time, there are definitely a few traditions to partake in – one of which is afternoon tea. Tea has been enjoyed around the world for thousands of years, but ‘afternoon tea’ became a phenomenon during the mid-1800s thanks to the 7th Duchess of Bedford, Anna. She would leave a long stretch of time between lunch and dinner – with the gap being filled with tea, a sandwich and some cake. The tradition caught on amongst the upper classes and remains a British favourite to this day.
        <br>
         <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold">'Where to try:'</span> If you really want to splash the cash, then Claridge’s (Brook St, Mayfair) is the place to go in London for truly exquisite, traditional afternoon tea. For a cheaper (and quirkier) version, visit The Orangery (12 Crooms Hill) at London’s Fan Museum.

    <h3>Gin & Tonic</h3>
<p>
    Britons love a good drink – and one of the country’s most loved beverages is gin & tonic. Gin was feverishly imported from Holland by many in the upper classes during the 18th century, while tonic water was a key part of British colonialism in the 19th century, most notably as it helped Britons deal with tropical climates during their travels. Gin & tonic came together as a way to improve the taste of the tonic water, and the drink remains hugely popular in the UK today.<br>
    <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold">'Where to try:'</span> For an immersive gin-tasting experience, you’ll want to visit The Distillery (186 Portobello Rd) to taste their famed gin or to try your hand at gin-blending at The Ginstitute. If you want a chilled out, unique gin experience, try out the East London Liquor Company distillery (221 Grove Road, Bow Wharf) where you can watch gin being distilled as you drink.

<h3>Craft Beer</h3>
<p>
    London has a long history in the act and art of brewing – becoming the undisputed British capital of breweries during the 18th century. Despite being prolific throughout the 20th century, London’s brewing industry had collapsed by the 21st century – with there being only 14 breweries in the city by 2010. However, the craft beer movement has rejuvenated London as a brewery hub and it’s now thought that there are 80 breweries across the city today.
    <br> <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold">'Where to try:'</span> The place for craft beers in London is definitely the Bermondsey Beer Mile. There you’ll find the likes of Fourpure (22 Bermondsey Trading Estate, Rotherhithe New Rd) and The Kernel (Arch 11, Dockley Rd Industrial Estate) where you can sample interesting batches of brand new beers. </p>
