It has been a British favourite for well over 150 years and remains one of the most British dishes on any restaurant menu. The originator of the dish is contested – some credit a northern England native named John Lees, while others credit Joseph Malin, a Jewish immigrant living in East London. Nevertheless, the dish has become a popular takeaway meal across the country and, much like the Full English, is beloved in all corners of British society.<br> the content to make it appear or act a certain way.

The proliferation of pies was actually born out of a problem – storage issues. With boat crews needing to be sustained during trips, but not being able to accommodate livestock, pies were created as an economical (and delicious) way to store and preserve meat. While we can find pies in many guises across the world, the Great British meat pie (typically beef) remains a favourite across the country.

While many variations exist, the standard components include roast meat, stuffing, roast potatoes, Yorkshire puddings (a savoury, batter-based pastry), roast vegetables and gravy. So precious is this dish to the UK public that it was voted second in a poll of what they most love about Britain.<br>

Tea has been enjoyed around the world for thousands of years, but ‘afternoon tea’ became a phenomenon during the mid-1800s thanks to the 7th Duchess of Bedford, Anna. She would leave a long stretch of time between lunch and dinner – with the gap being filled with tea, a sandwich and some cake. The tradition caught on amongst the upper classes and remains a British favourite to this day.
